## Self XDSD Documentation

These are the docs for [self-xdsd.com](http://self-xdsd.com), the platform for
automated project management of distributed projects.

You can find here all the essential information that you need in order to get the
most out of Self.

If you need more urgent support, feel free to send us an e-mail at <a title="Feel free to drop us a line" href="mailto:support@self-xdsd.com">support@self-xdsd.com</a>.

Throughout this documentation, the word ``Github`` is interchangeable with ``GitLab``, as our ``Project Managers`` work in the same way whether your repository is hosted on [Github](https://github.com) or on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
